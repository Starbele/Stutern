      <h3>What I have learnt so far</h3>
      <p>
        HTML is a markup language used to create static web pages and web
        applications. CSS is a style sheet language responsible for the
        presentation of documents written in a markup language.
        background-color: green; HTML cannot be used in a CSS file.
      </p>
      <h4>Importance of CSS</h4>
      <p>
        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages — for
        example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content,
        split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative
        features.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Faster Page Speed More code means slower page speed. And CSS enables
          you to use less code. CSS allows you to use one CSS rule and apply it
          to all occurrences of a certain tag within an HTML document.
        </li>
        <li>
          CSS not only makes web pages easy on the eye, it also allows for
          user-friendly formatting. When buttons and text are in logical places
          and well organized, user experience improves.
        </li>
        <li>
          With CSS, you can apply specific formatting rules and styles to
          multiple pages with one string of code. One cascading style sheet can
          be replicated across several website pages. If, for instance, you have
          product pages that should all have the same formatting, look, and
          feel, writing CSS rules for one page will suffice for all pages of
          that same type.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you need to change the format of a specific set of pages, it’s easy
          to do so with CSS. There’s no need to fix every individual page. Just
          edit the corresponding CSS stylesheet and you’ll see changes applied
          to all the pages that are using that style sheet.
        </li>

        <h3>Differences between paddings, margins and borders</h3>
        <p>
          <span>Margins:</span> The CSS margin properties are used to create space
          around elements, outside of any defined borders. With CSS, you have full
          control over the margins. There are properties for setting the margin
          for each side of an element (top, right, bottom, and left).
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Paddings:</span> Padding is a term used to describe the process of
          filling a field with pad characters. For example, if a name field
          required ten characters and your name was "Bob" (3 characters) the field
          would be "Bob0000000" where the 0's are the padding characters.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Borders:</span> The border property is a shorthand syntax in CSS
          that accepts multiple values for drawing a line around the element it is
          applied to.
